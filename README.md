# User interface(login/register/newpost) using ORM
In this project,registered users can write confidential posts about non-members. Once registered are logged in, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.
This application has the data models and associations that allow users to submit links (“posts”). Using associations and foreign keys we're able to create links between tables that share information.
